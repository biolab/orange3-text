Need to work together to ensure strong encryption without giving room for terrorists, child pornographers: Josh Earnest The United States has raised an alarm over end-to-end encryption of all messages from Facebook-owned WhatsApp, saying that strong encryption should not provide cyber safe havens to terrorists and child pornographers. “It [WhatsApp decision] doesn’t change our policy or our view of how the federal government and the technology industry can and should be able to work together to ensure that strong encryption can be robustly deployed without giving terrorists or child pornographers or other bad actors a safe haven in cyberspace,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. “It’s complicated, but a policy needed” “It’s complicated and it’s technical, in part because these policies and the technology itself are rapidly changing. It means that we need to have a policy that can adapt along with it. That kind of innovation is healthy,” he noted. Mr. Earnest said work had been done together with the messaging app for fighting cyber crimes like child pornography. Child porn, terror “There are areas where we’ve been able to work together to get this done, including fighting things like child pornography. And hopefully when it comes to keeping the American people safe from terrorism, we should be able to work together to stop that, too,” he said in response to a question. On Tuesday, WhatsApp, which has more than a billion users, said it had introduced encryption to all its services. Whatsapp says encryption important “Encryption is one of the most important tools, governments, companies and individuals have to promote safety and security in the new digital age. Recently there had been a lot of discussion about encrypted services and the work of law enforcement,” WhatsApp said in a blog post. “While we recognise the important work of law enforcement in keeping people safe, efforts to weaken encryption risk exposing people’s information to abuse from cybercriminals, hackers, and rogue states,” it said. ‘Only intended recipients can read it’ WhatsApp said end-to-end encrypted messages can only be read by the intended recipients. “And if you’re using the latest version of WhatsApp, you don’t have to do a thing to encrypt your messages: end-to-end encryption is on by default and all the time,” it said.		20160407	U.S.: Whatsapp encryption shouldn’t give safe havens for cyber crime	http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-whatsapp-encryption-shouldnt-give-safe-havens-for-cyber-crime/article8445011.ece
Give diesel a break, says Tata Motors MD The company's newly-appointed MD says automobile is responsible for a very small part of the total pollution bill Swaraj Baggonkar Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Targeting diesel and holding it responsible for all the pollution issues plaguing the country is unfair and improper, said Guenter Butschek, new managing director of Tata Motors.“It is not fair to target a particular fuel, (just) as it is not fair to only target the automotive sector. The sector, as proven by statics, is actually responsible for (only) a smaller part of the total pollution bill,” he said on Wednesday at the launch of the company’s Tiago hatchback.Tata is among a host of companies, including Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Mercedes-Benz, severely impacted by recent pollution control measures. These include a ban on sale of all diesel vehicles in the National Capital Region (NCR) having engines above 2,000cc, since December 2015.Additionally, the government for the first time levied a tax in the Union Budget on the basis of fuel type, not on the dimensions or specifications of vehicles, traditionally the case. A 2.5 per cent infrastructure cess was levied on diesel passenger vehicles; petrol counterparts saw a one per cent cess.“(Instead of) addressing pollution from all different angles and to pick out one particular element (like a) guinea pig, so to say, and put all the pollution issue on this one fuel or technology is not proper,” mourned Butschek.Late last month, the Bihar government proposed a ban on sale of diesel vehicles above 2,000cc, after high pollution levels in the state capital during the winter months.Following all this increased activism against diesel, companies are revisiting plans of investment in development of diesel technology. Pawan Goenka, executive director at M&M, had said in December: “When we make an investment, we have to know that the investment will live out its life.”While the battle to lift the ban on sale of diesel cars could go on in the Supreme Court, companies are looking for internal solutions. For instance, M&M, largest manufacturer of sports utility vehicles, has diversified into petrol engines for its small SUVs for the time being. The company has indicated all its models will come with a petrol engine option.Additionally, at least two of its models, the Scorpio and XUV500, are presently sold with a 1,990cc engine, circumventing the NCR diesel ban. Tata Motors had indicated earlier this year during the Auto Expo that it was also working on sub-2,000cc engines for its utility vehicle range.“The whole pollution issue requires far more global review. Global not in terms of around the world but in terms of the perspective, a more holistic approach. We are very strongly committed to fuel efficiency (and) to ecologically responsible drivetrains. We are open to all kinds of discussions, we fully support the government but let us actually address the problem,” said Butschek.Tata Motors has a very strong diesel background. It launched the Tiago (formerly named Zica) with a compact diesel engine option alongside a petrol engine. The diesel engine, a newly developed turbo-charged mill, delivers nearly 28 km a litre.“We are pretty much known in the market for diesel. We have the most advanced three-cylinder petrol engine which is seen in the Tiago. We are as strong in the petrol engine as we are known in diesel engines. We will make ourselves independent from diesel because we believe we have the capability and competences, and we will follow the market demand at an appropriate speed,” added Butschek.

Based on its strong stock price jump since sharing its fiscal 2016 Q1 earnings results on Oct. 22, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is finally rewarding longtime shareholders for their patience. With the stock up 13% since beating analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings per share, it’s safe to say most investors and industry pundits liked what they heard. Combined with its solid 2.65% dividend yield, Microsoft stock offered a world of opportunity heading into fiscal 2016 Q1. Microsoft Corporation Stock: Is It Too Late to Get Onboard? So is there any more room to run for investors who hadn’t jumped onboard Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s “mobile-first, cloud-first” train? The answer lies in how Microsoft delivered on Nadella’s key initiatives, and based on that, all signs point to “yes.” Just the facts On a GAAP basis, including one-time items, Microsoft’s $20.4 billion in sales last quarter was a 12% decline compared with last year, though it did slightly exceed analyst expectations. On the EPS front, Microsoft really nailed it last quarter by reporting a 6% improvement in EPS, to $0.57. Last quarter’s revenue looks better after removing the impact of deferring nearly $1.3 billion in Windows 10 sales, declining just 7% year over year. Somewhat surprisingly given Microsoft’s strong results of late was the drop in Surface revenue in Q1, from last year’s $908 million to $672 million. Of course, with the new Surface Book on the way and the expansion of its re-seller base from about 150 to more than 4,500 sales folks, sluggish Surface results will probably take a turn for the better over the holiday season. Microsoft’s Windows revenue once again declined last quarter. Nadella did point out that the drop in what was Microsoft’s former bread-and-butter product was only 6%, which was “better than the overall PC market” thanks to the wildly successful introduction of Windows 10. Slowing quarterly phone revenue has also been a consistent theme, which continued in Q1. So why would lower total revenue and device sales drive Microsoft’s stock price up more than double digits in a week? How’d they do that? A primary reason Microsoft stock jumped was the continued growth of its cloud sales. The whopping $5.9 billion of “intelligent cloud” revenue in Q1 was an 8% improvement year over year, and Microsoft now boasts an annual run rate of over $8.2 billion. To put that into perspective, fellow tech behemoth IBM (NYSE:IBM) is also committed to the fast-growing cloud market, and its $4.5 billion annual run rate is nothing to sneeze at, but it pales in comparison with Microsoft’s results. One reason for Microsoft’s strong cloud sales, which puts it directly in IBM’s big data wheelhouse, is an emphasis on growing cloud-based analytics. In a market that’s expected to reach as much as $125 billion this year, there’s a lot at stake in winning the data-analytics wars. Considering that much of the big data amassed in today’s digital world is hosted in the cloud, the two high-growth markets go hand in hand. And there’s more As impressive as Microsoft’s cloud results were, it was hardly the only upside last quarter. With over 110 million devices already running Windows 10, Microsoft has taken a big step toward reaching its goal of 1 billion users. Better still, the early success of Windows 10 drove strong results across other key areas, including mobile. Last quarter saw over 200 million downloads of Office 365 to mobile devices, which speaks directly to Nadella’s mobile strategy: Get Microsoft products and services into the hands of as many users as possible, regardless of device or operating system. Microsoft’s mobile efforts also helped its Bing search engine to show a profit in Q1, thanks to a 29% increase in ad sales, excluding the impact of currency. For much the same reason, Microsoft’s Dynamics CRM revenue jumped again last quarter, up 12%, and there are three times as many online users compared with last year. When it’s said and done, Microsoft hit home runs where it counted — mobile and cloud-related sales — and it appears that momentum will continue. Add it all up, and investors in search of a solid growth and income alternative should still have Microsoft at, or near, the top of their buy list. This $19 trillion industry could destroy the Internet One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. It could make early investors wildly rich.

Microsoft to return to bond market in $US13bn sale Microsoft is planning to sell $US13 billion in debt, its biggest bond sale ever that eclipses a mark set just eight months ago, according to a person familiar with the matter. The tech giant, one of only three non-financial companies with top AAA ratings, will sell the debt in as many as seven parts as soon as today, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. The longest portion is a 40-year bond that may yield 1.80 per centage points more than comparable government debt, the person said. “This is a banner year for tech issuance, so they needed to price wide to get people to take down $US13 billion,” CreditSights analyst Jordan Chalfin said in an interview. “For Microsoft, an extra five-10 basis points doesn’t really matter. Their debt-funded share buybacks are very accretive for equity holders.” The company said in a filing on Thursday it will use the proceeds for anything from working capital to stock repurchases and repayment of existing debt. OFFER CONCESSIONS Wells Fargo & Co. analysts led by Nicole Black forecast in an Oct. 23 note that the software company would have to offer a new issue concession of as much as 0.15 per centage point to lure debt buyers to a large deal. The company is likely taking advantage of its “attractive” cost of debt financing to issue before a potential Federal Reserve interest rate increase in December, Black wrote. The company issued$US10.8 billion of securities in February, at the time its biggest bond sale ever. Microsoft’s bonds are trading the tightest among its high-grade tech peers, CreditSights wrote. Microsoft shares are trading near a 15-year high after it reported last week that profit exceeded analysts’ estimates in the quarter ended Sept. 30,??buoyed by demand for Internet-based programs that handle business tasks and host companies’ applications. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been focused on selling Microsoft’s Azure cloud services and Office 365 subscription-based products, bolstering the company’s new Intelligent Cloud and Productivity segments. Office 365 added 3 million consumer subscribers and revenue from the commercial version grew almost 70 per cent in constant currency, while Azure sales more than doubled from a year earlier. The shares were down 0.6 per cent at $US53.66 on Thursday. They were up 16 per cent this year through Wednesday, compared with a 1.5 per cent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Microsoft beats on top and bottom lines; stock pops Microsoft’s server and cloud businesses did well. Revenue in Intelligent Cloud, which includes server products and Azure, reported an 8 percent increase to $5.9 billion. In addition, Microsoft’s decision last summer to pare back its struggling Nokia division meant the company made less money from selling mobile phones. The subscriber base for Office 365 grew by 3 million additional users, bringing the total to 18.2 million. Microsoft Corporation is a public multinational corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington, US that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of products and services predominantly related to computing through… The U.S. tech giant said third-quarter profit edged up 2 percent to US$4.6 billion, while revenue dipped 12 percent to US$23.2 billion, hit by currency movements. Net income was at $4.6 billion, a 2 percent increase. “Cloud continues to be the Rock of Gibraltar for Microsoft as this was a source of strength yet again in the quarter”, FBC Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said. Microsoft “defied the skeptics” by showing growth in key areas, he added. According to Microsoft, about one-fifth of Bing usage in September came from Windows 10 devices. The reason for the spike in price is likely tied to the strong growth of its cloud computing business that many to be the future of the company. “I think of it as the edge of our cloud“, he said. Windows volume licensing to enterprises grew by 4 percent. Windows 10: Analysts will have their eye on Windows 10 adoption and its impact on Microsoft’s earnings. Microsoft hopes to make up the revenue from other sources. While Microsoft Windows remains the dominant PC operating system, it has lost leadership to Google and Apple Inc in mobile. In more good news, Office 365’s subscriber base grew across both consumer and commercial markets. The launch of Windows 10, it says, has helped the ecosystem and is pushing people toward more expensive computers. That in turn could give consumers more reason to use those devices. 3 million more people joined the successful Office 365 subscription service, and Microsoft’s little-known Salesforce competitor called Dynamics even recorded a 12% growth in sales (while tripling the number of its customers). “It is a really strong quarter and these guys are ahead of most of the traditional software companies moving to the cloud in terms of where they are in the evolution”, Moerdler said. Two other categories consolidate Microsoft’s other major revenue sources.		20160525	Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been focused on selling Microsoft’s Azure cloud services	http://www.albanydailystar.com/technology/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-has-been-focused-on-selling-microsofts-azure-cloud-services-corpus-christi-tech-day-7766.html
"""Are cricket matches more important than people,"" this is the question the Bombay High Court posed on Wednesday to the state government, Mumbai Cricket Association and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). A division bench of justice VM Kande and justice MS Karnik also suggested that in the present condition when the state is facing a drought-like situation, the Indian Premier League tournament, which begins from April 9, be moved out to another state where there is sufficient water. The observation was made during the hearing of a Public Interest Litigation filed by an NGO, Loksatta Movement, seeking directions to the government to move IPL outside Maharashtra. It claimed that around 40 to 60 lakh litres of water will be used to maintain pitches. This instead could be diverted to people facing severe shortage of water in Vidarbha and Marathwada regions. During the hearing, at one point when the MCA argued that it only provided stadiums and the BCCI was the final authority on holding the tournament, the court said, ""Only if water supply to BCCI is cut, you will understand."" The court also told the state that ultimately it is the government's responsibility and duty to do something about this (water wastage) and impose some kind of restraint. It also asked the state government to spell out on Thursday what steps it plans to take on the issue. When asked by the court how much water is being used by MCA at Wankhede stadium to maintain the pitches, the counsel replied around 40 lakh litres of water for the seven IPL matches to be held there. To this the court said, it is a huge number. However, the counsel added that they are purchasing water to maintain the pitches and not using the corporation supply. This water is non-potable and cannot be used for drinking purposes. He also said that the association will come out with some contingency plan to tackle the water crisis."

"London: The number of known executions worldwide went up by more than 50 percent last year to at least 1,634, the highest figure recorded since 1989, Amnesty International said Wednesday. The surge was largely fuelled by Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, the London-based human rights organisation said in its annual report on death sentences and executions worldwide. The 1,634 figure does not include China, which is thought to have killed thousands of its own citizens. Death penalty data is ""treated as a state secret"" by Beijing, Amnesty said, as it is by Vietnam and Belarus. Recorded executions were up by 54 percent on 2014's figure of 1,061. Some 89 percent of those executions were carried out by Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia alone. ""The rise in executions last year is profoundly disturbing,"" said Amnesty secretary general Salil Shetty. ""Not for the last 25 years have so many people been put to death by states around the world. ""Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have all put people to death at unprecedented levels, often after grossly unfair trials. This slaughter must end. ""Thankfully, countries that execute belong to a small and increasingly isolated minority."" Pakistan lifted a six-year moratorium on the death penalty following the Peshawar school attack in December 2014. It executed 326 people in 2015, while Saudi Arabia put 158 people to death. Majority of countries abolitionist Iran executing at least 977 people is at odds with its opening up to the West after striking a deal with world powers last year on its nuclear ambitions, Amnesty said. ""Western countries are starting to build commercial ties and trade missions,"" said James Lynch, Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa deputy director. ""However, human rights has been absolutely left in the margins,"" he told AFP. ""That risks undermining all these efforts."" He said that since the mid-1980s, around half of those people executed in Saudi Arabia have been foreigners, largely migrant workers who did not speak Arabic and who had little legal assistance. For the first time ever, the majority of the world's countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes. Fiji, Madagascar, Republic of Congo and Suriname fully abolished the death penalty in 2015, taking the total number of countries to do so to 102. In China, Amnesty said there were signs that the number of executions has decreased in recent years, but it could not verify this. In August, nine crimes were removed from the list of offences punishable by death, bringing the total down to 43. ""We've been urging the Chinese government to come clean for years,"" Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty's East Asia regional director, told AFP. ""Executing several thousand people a year is really very serious and China knows it would be the black sheep of the international community if it was to release the numbers. ""What China needs is the very high number of executions and the judicial procurement of organs for transplant (from those killed) to come to light for the government to be moved into doing the right thing."" 'Questioning leader's policies' People were executed in 25 countries in 2015. The methods used were beheading, hanging, lethal injection and shooting. Amnesty said its reports indicted that four people in Iran and at least five in Pakistan were executed for crimes committed when they were aged under 18. Worldwide, people were sentenced to death or executed for murder, drug-related offences, corruption, armed robbery, adultery, aggravated rape, rape, apostasy, kidnapping, and insulting the prophet of Islam. A total of 28 people were executed in the United States. Forms of treason, including ""acts against national security"", ""collaboration"" with a foreign entity, ""espionage"", ""questioning the leader's policies"", participation in ""insurrectional movement"" were among those punished with death sentences. Amnesty recorded a drop in the number of death sentences imposed in 2015 compared to 2014, but this was partly due to difficulties in corroborating data, the charity said. At least 1,998 people were sentenced to death in 61 countries. At least 20,292 people worldwide were under sentence of death at the end of 2015."		20160407	Highest recorded number of executions since 1989; Iran, Pakistan top list: Amnesty	http://www.firstpost.com/world/highest-recorded-number-of-executions-since-1989-iran-pakistan-top-list-amnesty-2715694.html
